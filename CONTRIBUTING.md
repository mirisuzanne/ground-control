# Contributions are welcome!

Before making major changes,
[open an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/mirisuzanne/ground-control/issues/)
for discussion.

1. Clone
   [the source from Github](https://github.com/mirisuzanne/ground-control),
   and make changes directly
   to `ground-control.js`,
   `input-control.js`,
   and/or `toggle-control.js`.

2. Make sure any changes
   are reflected in working demos
   (`index.html`).

3. Copy any changes
   into the `*-raw.js` files --
   which should contain simple class definitions
   and registrations,
   without any module import/export syntax

4. Commit changes,
   and open a pull request.
